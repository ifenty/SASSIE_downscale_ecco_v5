    "comment": "Fraction of ocean grid cell covered with sea-ice [0 to 1]. CF Standard Name Table v73:  'Area fraction' is the fraction of a grid cell's horizontal area that has some characteristic of interest. It is evaluated as the area of interest divided by the grid cell area. It may be expressed as a fraction, a percentage, or any other dimensionless representation of a fraction. Sea ice area fraction is area of the sea surface occupied by sea ice. It is also called 'sea ice concentration'. 'Sea ice' means all ice floating in the sea which has formed from freezing sea water, rather than by other processes such as calving of land ice to form icebergs. https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/73/build/cf-standard-name-table.html.

Sea ice area fraction is area of the sea surface occupied by sea ice. It is also called 'sea ice concentration'. 'Sea ice' means all ice floating in the sea which has formed from freezing sea water and precipitation, rather than by other processes such as calving of land ice to form icebergs. https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/73/build/cf-standard-name-table.html",
